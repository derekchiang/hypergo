# hypergo

`hypergo` is a Go client for [HyperDex](https://github.com/rescrv/HyperDex).  This is part of my research project.

## Installation

First of all, [install HyperDex](http://hyperdex.org/doc/latest/InstallingHyperDex/#chap:installation).  This is necessary because hypergo relies on HyperDex's official C client.

Then, `go get github.com/derekchiang/hypergo`

## Status

Usable.
